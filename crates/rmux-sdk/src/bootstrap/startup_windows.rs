//! Windows daemon startup race serialization for the SDK bootstrap layer.
//!
//! The Windows hidden-daemon launch path needs the same "exactly one
//! launcher per endpoint" guarantee the Unix `flock`-based bootstrap gives.
//! On Windows the documented primitive is a per-user named mutex held over
//! the `CreateNamedPipeW`/`first_pipe_instance(true)` window. This module
//! owns that gate, layered on top of the existing `rmux-ipc` Windows pipe
//! contract:
//!
//! * Endpoint names stay `\\.\pipe\rmux-{SID}-il-{integrity}-{label}`. This
//!   module never invents new pipe names.
//! * The same `IdentityResolver`/SID values that scope the pipe ACL also
//!   scope the mutex's discretionary ACL, so a peer running under a
//!   different identity cannot acquire the mutex or open the pipe.
//! * `ServerOptions::first_pipe_instance(true)` remains the authoritative
//!   first-instance enforcement inside `rmux-ipc`. The mutex prevents two
//!   `rmux` callers from racing to spawn that listener; it does not
//!   substitute for it.
//!
//! Race guard:
//!
//! 1. Probe the pipe with the existing framed bincode `HasSession` request.
//!    If the daemon answers, [`StartupOutcome::JoinedExisting`] is returned
//!    without ever touching the mutex.
//! 2. Otherwise acquire the per-endpoint named mutex.
//! 3. Re-probe under the mutex. If a peer started the daemon while we were
//!    waiting, return [`StartupOutcome::JoinedExisting`] without spawning.
//! 4. Run the launcher closure exactly once and wait for the new daemon to
//!    respond to the same probe.
//!
//! Busy/not-found/no-data/access-denied/timeout errors raised by the pipe or
//! the mutex surface as typed [`StartupError`] variants.
